Technologies: MERN, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, Cloudinary, Vite, MUI, Render, Vercel, GitHub

When I started building my portfolio website, the Projects section was static — any update meant manually editing content. I wanted a way to manage projects dynamically, and that’s how the idea of this MERN stack dashboard panel came to life. Now, I can add, update, view, and delete projects directly from the dashboard, and everything updates instantly on the live portfolio website.

To make it work seamlessly, I integrated cloud image uploads with Cloudinary, stored project data in MongoDB Atlas, and built a clean API-driven architecture. The frontend uses Vite + React + MUI for a fast, modern experience, while the backend runs on Node.js + Express with Nodemon for efficient development. Reusable components ensure that forms handle both adding and editing projects without duplicating code.

Deployments were the final piece of the puzzle: the frontend lives on Vercel, the backend runs on Render, and GitHub handles version control. Seeing the dashboard fully power my portfolio website — from data entry to live dynamic updates — has been an incredibly rewarding experience and a real-world test of building full-stack, deployable applications.
